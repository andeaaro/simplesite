## Selecting native plants to improve urban pollinator habitat
As a PhD Candidate at Oregon State University, I am studying the attractiveness of native wildflowers to pollinators and natural enemies, especially flowers with aesthetic value. This information has the potential to inform deliberate plantings that increase the habitat value of home gardens, urban parks, roadsides, and agricultural landscapes. This fits into my advisor Dr. Gail Langellotto's ongoing work in garden ecology. More information on our lab's on-goings can be found here:   http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/gardenecologylab/

"Saving the bees" is currently a hot-button issue in entomology, as well as among agricultural producers and savvy consumers.

Currently I am running a large field trial at OSU's North Willamette Research Center. I selected 23 native Willamette Valley wildflower species based on drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal, as well as four exotic garden species known to be attractive to bees for comparison. During the spring of 2017, we planted five meter squared plots of each species (forming five "blocks" of all 27 species for replication). Weekly, we monitor the floral bloom, perform timed pollinator observations, and use a ghost-busters looking "insect vacuum" to sample insects on each plot. From this research I plan on developing empirically based, pollinator-friendly planting lists of PNW natives. Stay tuned for updates as the field season progresses!
